# Project: Custom Mechanical Hand Prosthesis

## General Description
This project focuses on the **design and development of a fully customized mechanical hand prosthesis**, created based on the scanned dimensions of the patient’s residual limb. The main objective was to achieve a **personalized and ergonomic prosthetic design**, providing both structural functionality and user comfort.

The process began with a **3D scanning procedure** to capture the precise geometry of the patient’s limb. The digital model was then processed and used as the foundation for the **mechanical design in CAD software**, ensuring dimensional accuracy and a natural fit.

## Project Objective
To create a **custom mechanical prosthesis** using 3D scanning and mechanical modeling technologies, ensuring a precise anatomical adaptation that improves usability, fit, and comfort for the end user.

## Components and Technologies Used
- 3D scanner for anatomical data acquisition  
- CAD software for digital modeling and design  
- Parametric modeling and mechanical structure design  
- Additive manufacturing preparation (for future printing and assembly)  

## Results
The project successfully resulted in the **creation of a mechanical prosthetic model tailored to the user’s anatomy**.  
Through the integration of **3D scanning and mechanical design tools**, it demonstrated the potential for developing affordable and highly accurate prosthetic solutions for biomedical applications.

## Areas of Application
- Biomedical Engineering  
- Mechanical Design  
- Robotics and Mechatronics
