# Dual Axis Mechanical Arm Design

## Overview
This project presents the **mechanical design of a two-degree-of-freedom robotic arm**, developed in **SolidWorks**.  
The system integrates **two DC motors** and a **worm gear mechanism**, providing controlled movement and torque transmission across both joints.

## Objective
To design a robotic arm with two degrees of freedom capable of precise and stable movement using DC motors and a worm gear drive system, ensuring mechanical efficiency and motion control.

## Technologies and Components
- SolidWorks for 3D mechanical design  
- Two DC motors  
- Worm gear transmission system  
- 3D modeling and assembly tools  

## Development Process
1. **Concept design:** defining the kinematic structure and degrees of freedom.  
2. **3D modeling:** creation of each mechanical component in SolidWorks.  
3. **Integration of DC motors:** adaptation of housings and supports for motion actuation.  
4. **Worm gear implementation:** design of the torque transmission system for one axis.  
5. **Assembly and simulation:** verification of mechanical movement and design validation.  

## Results
The project achieved a complete and functional **3D model of a 2DOF robotic arm**, integrating motors, gears, and mechanical linkages.  
This design serves as the foundation for future robotic applications requiring motion control and precise mechanical articulation.
