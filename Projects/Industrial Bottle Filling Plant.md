# Industrial Bottle Filling Plant

## Overview
This project presents a **simulation of an industrial bottle filling plant** developed in Unity.  
The system models the complete operation of a bottling line, including filling, conveyor transport, and quality control processes.  
The simulation integrates **multiple sensors**, a **Programmable Logic Controller (PLC)**, and a **variable frequency drive (VFD)** for realistic industrial process control.

## Objective
To develop a realistic and interactive simulation of a bottle filling plant that demonstrates the integration of automation systems, sensor networks, and motor control for industrial processes.  
This platform serves as a tool for training, prototyping, and testing industrial automation concepts.

## Technologies and Components
- **Unity 3D Engine** for simulation and visualization  
- **PLC simulation** to manage control logic  
- **Variable Frequency Drive (VFD)** to control conveyor and filling system speed  
- **Sensors:** proximity sensors, flow sensors, and level sensors for monitoring and automation  
- **C# scripting** for logic, sensor interaction, and process control  
- **3D models of bottles, conveyors, and filling equipment**  

## Development Process
1. **System Design:** Define the layout of the bottling plant, including conveyor paths, filling stations, and sensor positions.  
2. **3D Modeling:** Create or import 3D models representing the bottles, conveyors, and industrial equipment.  
3. **PLC and Sensor Integration:** Simulate PLC logic and sensor inputs to manage filling, movement, and safety conditions.  
4. **Motor Control:** Implement VFD logic to regulate conveyor speeds and filling operations.  
5. **Testing:** Verify system behavior under normal and edge-case scenarios.  
6. **Iteration:** Refine sensor placements, PLC logic, and animations for realistic performance and visualization.  

## Results
The simulation provides a **fully functional interactive model** of an industrial bottle filling plant.  
It demonstrates the real-time operation of conveyors, filling stations, and automated sensors, offering a platform for education, training, and proof-of-concept automation testing.
