# PCB Planning and Integration

## Overview
This project showcases the **planning and assembly of an improvised printed circuit board (PCB)** for prototyping electronic systems.  
It integrates multiple modules including motor drivers, microcontrollers, and communication interfaces, mounted on a custom 3D-printed board for experimentation and testing.

## Objective
To design and assemble a versatile PCB prototype that allows the integration of various electronic modules for testing, experimentation, and proof-of-concept development.

## Technologies and Components
- **Microcontroller modules** (e.g., ESP32, Arduino-compatible boards)  
- **Motor driver modules**  
- **Voltage regulators and power modules**  
- **Custom 3D-printed PCB support**  
- **Wiring and connectors for modular assembly**  

## Development Process
1. **Planning:** Define module placements and connectivity requirements on the improvised PCB.  
2. **3D support design:** Create custom mounts to securely hold each module in place.  
3. **Integration:** Assemble all electronic modules on the PCB support.  
4. **Testing:** Verify electrical connections and module functionality.  
5. **Iteration:** Adjust layout and connections for optimal organization and accessibility.  

## Results
A functional improvised PCB was created, enabling easy integration of multiple modules for prototyping purposes.  
This setup provides a flexible platform for rapid testing of electronic circuits and development of experimental systems.
