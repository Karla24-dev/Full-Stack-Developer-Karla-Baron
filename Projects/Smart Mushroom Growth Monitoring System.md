# Smart Mushroom Growth Monitoring System

## Overview
This project presents a **real-time monitoring system for mushroom cultivation**, designed to track and collect data on the growth conditions of mushrooms.  
It integrates multiple sensors and controllers to ensure optimal environmental conditions, providing valuable insights for cultivation and research.

## Objective
To monitor the growth conditions of mushrooms in real-time, collecting data on environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and light intensity, to optimize growth and improve yield.

## Technologies and Components
- **Raspberry Pi 5** (central processing and data management)  
- **ESP32** (sensor integration and communication)  
- **Various sensors**: temperature, humidity, light intensity, and more  
- **Phroton board** (hardware control)  
- **Humidifier control system**  
- **Software for data acquisition and monitoring**  

## Development Process
1. **System design:** Define the monitoring requirements and sensor placements.  
2. **Hardware integration:** Connect sensors, Raspberry Pi, ESP32, and control boards.  
3. **Software development:** Implement code for data acquisition, sensor reading, and real-time monitoring.  
4. **Automation setup:** Control humidifiers and other actuators based on sensor data.  
5. **Testing and calibration:** Ensure accuracy of measurements and system responsiveness.  

## Results
The system successfully achieved **real-time monitoring of mushroom growth**, providing precise environmental data and automated control over cultivation conditions.  
This setup allows for improved growth optimization and data-driven insights for mushroom cultivation.
