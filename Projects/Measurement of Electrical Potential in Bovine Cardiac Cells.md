# Project: Measurement of Electrical Potential in Bovine Cardiac Cells

## General Description
This project focuses on the **measurement and analysis of the electrical potential in cardiac cells** extracted from a bovine heart. The study aims to understand the **bioelectrical behavior of cardiac tissue** and to visualize how electrical activity propagates through muscular fibers responsible for heart contractions.

Through a controlled laboratory setup, electrodes were placed in contact with the heart tissue to **record the potential differences generated by cardiac cells**. These measurements help illustrate the physiological mechanisms that sustain the rhythmic function of the heart.

## Project Objective
To study the **bioelectrical properties of cardiac tissue** by measuring voltage changes across different regions of a bovine heart, simulating the electrophysiological environment present in living organisms.

## Components and Tools Used
- Bovine heart (fresh cardiac tissue sample).  
- Measurement electrodes for potential recording.  
- Oscilloscope or voltage acquisition system.  
- Power and grounding system for data collection.  
- Laboratory instruments for tissue handling and fixation.  

## Results
The experimental setup successfully captured **variations in electrical potential between different areas of cardiac tissue**, providing insight into the functioning of **action potentials and propagation of electrical impulses**.  
These findings demonstrate the fundamental electrical coordination required for cardiac contraction and rhythm generation, contributing to the understanding of **bioelectrical physiology**.

## Areas of Application
