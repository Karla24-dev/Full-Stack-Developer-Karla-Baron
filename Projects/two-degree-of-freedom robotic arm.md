# WiFi Drawing Arm 2DOF

## Overview
This project presents a **two-degree-of-freedom robotic arm** controlled by an **ESP32** microcontroller, designed to **draw shapes and follow trajectories**.  
The system uses two **metal gear servo motors** to control its motion and a **marker as the end effector**, allowing it to reproduce drawings or paths on a flat surface.  

## Objective
To design and implement a robotic system capable of performing drawing tasks by following predefined trajectories, controlled remotely through WiFi communication and actuated by two servo motors providing two degrees of freedom.

## Technologies and Components
- ESP32 microcontroller with WiFi control  
- Two metal gear servo motors (one large and one small)  
- Marker as end effector  
- Custom 3D printed structure  
- Mechanical assembly and calibration  
- Power supply and control electronics  

## Development Process
1. **Mechanical design and 3D printing:** modeling and fabrication of the robot structure.  
2. **Assembly:** installation of the servos and linkage system for two degrees of freedom.  
3. **Control system:** ESP32 programming for servo coordination and WiFi-based interface.  
4. **Testing and calibration:** trajectory tuning and movement precision adjustment.  
5. **Drawing execution:** validation of the arm’s ability to trace and reproduce simple figures.  

## Results
The robotic arm was successfully assembled and programmed, achieving precise movement control and the ability to draw trajectories remotely.  
The system demonstrates an efficient integration between mechanical design, embedded control, and wireless communication.
