# Industrial Part Replica

## Overview
This project focuses on the **replication of an industrial mechanical part** through **reverse engineering**, 3D modeling in **SolidWorks**, and **3D printing using PLA**.  
The main goal was to **reproduce a hard-to-find component** while maintaining its original dimensions and tolerances.

## Objective
To design and manufacture an accurate replica of an industrial part from an existing physical model using CAD tools and 3D printing, exploring the reverse engineering process and its potential in the replacement and prototyping of industrial components.

## Technologies and Tools
- SolidWorks for 3D modeling  
- FDM 3D printer  
- PLA material  
- Slicer software for print preparation  

## Development Process
1. **Original part analysis:** dimensional measurement and reference gathering  
2. **3D modeling in SolidWorks:** geometry replication and tolerance adjustment  
3. **Print preparation:** slicing optimization for layer height and supports  
4. **Manufacturing:** 3D printing of the final part in PLA  
5. **Dimensional evaluation:** comparison between the replica and the original part  

## Results
The mechanical part was successfully **replicated and printed**, demonstrating the feasibility of reproducing industrial components using low-cost materials and accessible digital fabrication technologies.
