# Optical Reflection and Refraction Study

## Objective
To analyze the behavior of light through mirrors and crystals, exploring the principles of reflection, refraction, and diffraction.

## Description
This project consisted of a practical optical experiment aimed at studying how light interacts with different materials and surfaces. Using lasers, mirrors, and crystals, the study focused on observing how light behaves when changing its medium and angle of incidence, validating the theoretical principles of geometric optics.

## Components and Tools
- Mirrors  
- Lasers  
- Measuring rulers  
- Crystals  

## Results
The experiments successfully demonstrated how reflection and refraction depend on the material and angle of incidence. Different optical effects were observed, such as beam deviation, light dispersion, and multiple reflections, which visually confirmed theoretical predictions.

## Areas of Knowledge
Optics, Physics, Experimental Design

## Development Process
Design and setup of the experiment, alignment of optical components, calibration of laser sources, and collection of visual and quantitative data.
