# Project: Anatomical Segmentation and Visualization of the Lower Limb Using 3D Slicer

## General Description
This project focuses on the **analysis and segmentation of anatomical structures of the lower limb** using diagnostic imaging and the open-source software **3D Slicer**. The main goal was to explore how to **filter, isolate, and visualize specific tissues**—such as bones, muscles, or blood vessels—from medical scans.

The project highlights the application of 3D Slicer in **biomedical image processing**, emphasizing its capabilities for visualization, segmentation, and tissue differentiation in three-dimensional space.

## Project Objective
To study and process diagnostic imaging of the lower limb in order to **selectively filter and identify anatomical structures** using the 3D Slicer platform. This includes the segmentation of key elements like bones, vascular structures, and soft tissues for educational and research purposes.

## Components and Tools Used
- **3D Slicer**: Open-source platform for visualization and analysis of medical images.  
- **Diagnostic imaging data** (lower limb).  
- Segmentation and tissue isolation tools.  
- Visualization and rendering modules in 3D.

## Results
The project successfully demonstrated the ability to:
- Filter and visualize specific anatomical components of the lower limb.  
- Apply segmentation techniques to medical images.  
- Generate detailed 3D reconstructions for educational and research analysis.  

These results validate the potential of **3D Slicer** as an accessible and versatile tool for biomedical image analysis and anatomical study.

## Areas of Application
- Biomedical Engineering  
- Medical Imaging  
- Anatomy and Physiology Education
