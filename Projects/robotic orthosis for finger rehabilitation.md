# Robotic Finger Rehabilitation Orthosis with Servo Motor and ESP32

## Overview
This project presents the design of a **robotic orthosis for finger rehabilitation**, developed using 3D printing.  
It incorporates a **servo motor** controlled by an **ESP32 microcontroller**, allowing controlled flexion and extension of the fingers to facilitate rehabilitation.

## Objective
To design a robotic orthosis that assists finger rehabilitation through servo motor-controlled movements, providing an accessible and effective solution for patients with limited finger mobility.

## Technologies and Components
- **ESP32** (microcontroller)  
- **Servo motor**  
- **3D Printing** (for orthosis fabrication)  
- **Force sensors** (optional, for tactile feedback)  
- **Control software** (developed in Arduino IDE)  

## Development Process
1. **Conceptual design:** Define the structure of the orthosis and required movements.  
2. **3D modeling:** Create orthosis components using CAD software.  
3. **3D printing:** Fabricate the prototype parts.  
4. **Electronic integration:** Assemble the ESP32 and servo motor into the orthosis.  
5. **Programming:** Develop the code to control the servo motor and sensors.  
6. **Testing and adjustments:** Evaluate functionality and user comfort.  

## Results
A functional orthosis was developed that allows controlled finger movement, facilitating rehabilitation exercises.  
The device is lightweight, accessible, and adaptable to different hand sizes.
