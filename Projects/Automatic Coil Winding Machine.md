# Automatic Coil Winding Machine

## Overview
This project consists of the design and construction of an **automatic coil winding machine** for motor coil fabrication.  
The system was **designed from scratch**, integrating mechanical, electronic, and control components to achieve precise coil winding for electromechanical applications.

## Objective
To develop a functional coil winding machine capable of producing uniform and consistent windings for electric motors, through the integration of mechanical design, electronic control, and real-time operation.

## Technologies and Components
- DC motors with encoders  
- H-Bridge motor driver  
- Wall power adapter  
- Aluminum and sheet metal structure  
- Lathe-like cups for coil holding  
- Custom-designed coils  
- SolidWorks for mechanical modeling and design  

## Development Process
1. **Mechanical design:** full modeling and simulation in SolidWorks.  
2. **Fabrication:** structure manufactured using sheet metal and aluminum components.  
3. **Assembly:** integration of DC motors, couplings, and coil holders.  
4. **Electronics setup:** H-Bridge motor control and encoder feedback configuration.  
5. **Programming and testing:** implementation of motor control logic and operational validation.  

## Results
A fully functional **coil winding machine** was successfully designed, built, and programmed.  
The system demonstrates mechanical precision, stable control, and effective winding capability suitable for electric motor coils.
