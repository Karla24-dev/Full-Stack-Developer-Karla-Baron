# Automated Multi-Level Transport System

## Overview
This project presents the design and implementation of an **automated transport system** capable of moving boxes across **four vertical levels**.  
The system integrates **stepper motors**, an **ESP32 controller**, and a **copper coil acting as an electromagnet**, all coordinated to achieve precise and reliable movement between levels.

## Objective
To develop a multi-level automated transport mechanism capable of moving boxes through different platforms, using stepper motors, a microcontroller, and an electromagnet for object handling and positioning.

## Technologies and Components
- ESP32 microcontroller  
- Two stepper motors  
- Two stepper motor drivers  
- 3D-printed structures for the four levels  
- Copper coil functioning as an electromagnet  
- LCD display for real-time process visualization  

## Development Process
1. **Mechanical structure design:** modeling and printing the multi-level frame using 3D printing.  
2. **Motor integration:** configuration of two stepper motors and corresponding drivers.  
3. **Control system:** ESP32 programming for coordinated motion and electromagnet control.  
4. **LCD interface:** displaying the system’s operational states and transitions.  
5. **Testing and validation:** ensuring stable vertical motion and reliable box transfer between levels.  

## Results
The system successfully achieved **automated transport across four levels**, combining electromechanical precision with real-time feedback through an LCD display.  
This project demonstrates the integration of mechanical design, control automation, and embedded systems for efficient material handling.
